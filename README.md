This is a staff training presentation for privacy tools installed on public facing computers. 

There is an accompanying audio from a radio show for public outreach regarding the implementation of the tools, but that may not be applicable to your community.

The powerpoint presentation is updated for clarity. As a result the video recording will not directly match the powerpoint.
